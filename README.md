## Article abstract 
Cedar virus (CedV) is a nonpathogenic member of the Henipavirus (HNV) genus of emerging viruses, which includes the deadly Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses. CedV can form syncytia, a hallmark of henipaviral and paramyxoviral infections. However, the fusogenic capacity of CedV relative to NiV or HeV remains unquantified. HNV entry is mediated by concerted interactions between the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Upon receptor binding by the HNV G head domain, a fusion-activating G stalk region is exposed and triggers F to undergo a conformational cascade that leads to viral entry or cell-cell fusion. Here, we first demonstrated quantitatively that the CedV G/F pair is inherently significantly less fusogenic than the NiV G/F pair. To decipher these phenotypes, we generated and tested six headless CedV G mutants of distinct stalk C-terminal lengths, revealing highly hyperfusogenic headless CedV G mutants with 3 to 4-fold greater than wild-type CedV cell-cell fusion levels. We also generated headless HeV G mutants, which just as headless NiV G mutants yielded mildly hyperfusogenic fusion phenotypes compared to wild-type HeV G or NiV G. This indicates that the G head/stalk junction is key to modulating HNV fusogenicity and supports an “induced fit” model of paramyxoviral stalk exposure and fusion triggering. Further, heterotypic NiV/CedV coimmunoprecipitation and cell-cell fusion assays showed heterotypic henipaviral G/F bidentate interactions and evidence that the HNV G head domain may be involved in the fusion cascade beyond receptor binding or promoting G stalk exposure. Additionally, our study demonstrates that CedV is a good model to elucidate important aspects of HNV entry and pathogenicity.
